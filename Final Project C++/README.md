##Author:

##Goal:
* The 3D Modeling Project will create computer aided design software that will operate based on C++ instructions. 
* The program will have the ability to create and manipulate 3D and 2D shapes, and save results and outcomes as an STL file.
* Shapes will be able to be translated, rotated, scaled and colored.
* 2D shapes will be able to be Extruded along a path to create a 3D shape.
* 3D shapes will be able to be printed on a 3D printer.
